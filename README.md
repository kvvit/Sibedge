# Test task answers
### 1.Please write iptables rules that will block all incoming traffic and allow outgoing (browsing from local machine should work, but all incoming connections should be dropped).
Answer: most easy way to set policy for chains INPUT and FORWARD to DROP (or REJECT) and for chain OUTPUT to ACCEPT. I also usually open all for loopback interface. File from iptables-restore take rules has view:
```
*filter
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -i enp0s3 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

-P INPUT DROP
-P FORWARD DROP
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT

COMMIT
```
But I usually set policy for all chains to DROP, and my config file for iptables has view:
```
*filter

-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -i enp0s3 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -o enp0s3 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -i enp0s3 -s 192.168.1.101/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i enp0s3 -s 92.168.1.101/32  -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT

-A INPUT -j LOG

-P INPUT DROP
-P FORWARD DROP
-P OUTPUT DROP

COMMIT
```
Here is enp0s3 ethernet interface in local machine (can be different in some virtuallization systems), and also I open ssh and icmp for my management station (it ip-address is 192.168.1.101)
### 2. There is a directory with 2 files that are shown as '???' and '???'. They have different names, but in console are shown as 3 question marks. How to remove them?
Answer:
### 3. If you want to upload some file once per hour to 1 server from 1000 servers, how it can be done? What special cases should be taken into account?
Answer: We admit, that we can connect to 1000 servers via ssh, and  that we use rsa-key. In my examples I chose nginx.conf file, and check if it exist on remote server. For the name of copied file I use next format: nginx.conf-remote_server_name-timestamp (to avoid duplicate names). I would like to show two ways how to solve our task (this two methods use ssh):
- Use bash script. I have written file, with list of names of our servers, it called servers.txt, and have view:
```
[all]
server0001.somedomainname
server0002.somedomainname
----
server1000.somedomainname
```
And bash script, that use list of servers (in same directory with servers list file)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
FILE_PATH=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
SCRIPT_PATH=/path_to_script/
servers=`cat ${SCRIPT_PATH}servers.txt |  awk 'NR>1'`
for s in $servers
do
  if ssh $s stat $FILE_PATH \> /dev/null 2\>\&1
    then
      echo "File exists on $s"
      timestamp=`date +"%H%M%S%d%m%Y"`
      scp $s:$FILE_PATH ${SCRIPT_PATH}nginx.conf-$s-$timestamp
    else
      echo "File does not exist on $s"
  fi
done
```
After that, I have made cron task in /etc/crontab (or can create file with same content in /etc/cron.d) with next content:
```
0 */1 * * * user bash /path_to_script/script.sh
```
- Use ansible. For inventory I have used same file with servers list, and have written next playbook (with check if remote file exist):
```yml
---
- hosts: all
  become: no
  tasks:

  - name: Get file from remote location
    fetch:
      src: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      dest: ./nginx.conf-{{ inventory_hostname }}-{{ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic}}
      fail_on_missing: no
      flat: yes
```
As in first example I have made cron task in /etc/crontab with next content:
```
0 */1 * * * user ansible-playbook -i /path_to_script/servers.txt /path_to_script/files.yml
```
### 4. You have a folder that stores backups of a few projects. Each project lays in a separate folder and each backup is a tarball file with unique name. Write a shell script that removes all backups for the given project except the last 5.
Answer: I assume, that backup directory is /backup. In that directory there are another directories with backup tarball files. In that directories can be placed other type of files, and my script donâ€™t affect on this files. Below is contain of the script for our task:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_PATH='/backup/'
cd ${BACKUP_PATH}
DIRS=`ls -d */`
for DIR in $DIRS
do
  cd $BACKUP_PATH$DIR
  ls *.tar -t 2> /dev/null | awk 'NR>5' | xargs rm 2> /dev/null
done
```
